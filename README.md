These are the codes of the labs from Machine Learning on Coursera

I took the on-demand course Machine Learning from Coursera in the summer of 2016 and these are the codes from the programming assignments. Detailed breakdowns of each assignment can be found at the PDF handout at each directory.

These programming assigments are little projects programmed in Octave. They managed to realize the implementation and functions of various machine learning models, such as linear/logistic regression with regularization, hand-written digit recognization (a 3-layer neural network) etc.
